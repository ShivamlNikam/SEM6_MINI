## Model Training and Validation
The CNN based deep learning model was trained and validated on the Food-101 dataset. This dataset contains 101,000 images of different types of foods, with 1,000 images per category. The model was trained using transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model as the base. The trained model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set.

## Calorie Tracking
The trained model was used to fetch the calorie count of each classified food item. The fetched calorie count was then displayed alongside the predicted food item.

## Simple Visualization
Simple visualizations were performed to demonstrate the implementation of the prediction of food items. The predicted food item along with its image and calorie count was displayed in a simple UI.

## Stremlit App
A simple streamlit app was created to dem![Uploading sc1.PNGâ€¦]()
onstrate the working of the trained model. The app allows the user to upload an image of a food item and get the predicted food item along with its calorie count.

## Food Tracking Camera App
A prototype of an intuitive application UI and the Food tracking camera app was created using computer vision and tensorflow. The app allows the user to take a picture of a food item using their phone's camera and get the predicted food item along with its calorie count.

Overall, this project showcases the potential of deep learning and computer vision in the field of food classification and calorie tracking.
